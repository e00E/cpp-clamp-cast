In c/c++ it is easy to accidentally invoke undefined behavior when converting a floating point number to an integer:

https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/implicit_conversion section "Floatingâ€“integral conversions":
> A prvalue of floating-point type can be converted to a prvalue of any integer type. The fractional part is truncated, that is, the fractional part is discarded. **If the value cannot fit into the destination type, the behavior is undefined** (even when the destination type is unsigned, modulo arithmetic does not apply).


This applies to innocuous looking code like

```c++
void foo(float f) {
    int i0 = f;
    int i1 = int(f);
    int i2 = static_cast<int>(f);
}
```

which does not even generate a warning.

`clamp-cast.hpp` is a c++17 header that makes it easy to safely perform such conversions by clamping the value into the bounds of the target integer type.

```c++
void foo(float f) {
    int i = clamp_cast<int>(f);
}
```

`test.cpp` contains tests and examples and can be compiled and run with `./compile-and-test.sh`.
